Installing Pandas & NumPy\n\nBefore we dive into data analysis, let's understand what a **library** is in programming.\n\n---\n\n### What is a Library?\n\n- A **library** is a collection of pre-written codes that you can use to make programming easier.\n- Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can **import** libraries that help you with specific tasks.\n- For example:\n  - **Pandas** helps with working with tables of data.\n  - **NumPy** helps with numerical calculations.\n\n---\n\n### How to Install Libraries (Pandas, NumPy)\n\nIf you don’t have these libraries installed yet, here are **two ways** to install them:\n\n#### 1. Using Command Prompt / Terminal\n\nOpen your command line interface and run:\n\n```bash\npip install pandas numpy\n```\n\nThis installs Pandas and NumPy globally for your Python environment.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Using Jupyter Notebook directly\n\nIn a Jupyter notebook cell, type this and run it:\n\n```python\n!pip install pandas numpy\n```\n\nThe exclamation mark `!` lets you run command-line instructions from inside the notebook.\n\n---\n\nAfter installation, you can import these libraries in your code like this:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n```\n\n---\n\nLet's test if you have Pandas and NumPy installed by importing them now!\n\n\n```python\n# Test importing pandas and numpy\ntry:\n    import pandas as pd\n    import numpy as np\n    print(\"Pandas version:\", pd.__version__)\n    print(\"NumPy version:\", np.__version__)\n    print(\"Libraries are installed and imported successfully!\")\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    print(\"One or more libraries are not installed yet.\")\n    print(\"Please install them using the instructions above and restart the notebook.\")\n```","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c4fedc75-0840-4061-aa35-09bda5c554e3"},{"source":"## Day 1: Foundations\n\n### 1.

Exploring the Data: Columns, Filtering, and Adding New Information\n\nWe have a big table of NBA game results. Now, let's learn how to:\n\n- **See just one part of the data** (like just the home team scores)  \n- **Find specific games** you’re interested in (for example, where the home team won)  \n- **Create a new column** that tells us extra information, like which team won each game  \n\n---\n\n#### 5.1 Looking at a Single Column\n\nThink of a DataFrame like a table or spreadsheet with many columns. If you want to see only *one* column, like the \"HOME_SCORE\" (points scored by the home team), you can do this:\n\n```python\n# Look at just the 'HOME_SCORE' column\nhome_scores = nba_df['HOME_SCORE']\nprint(\"Here are the first 5 home team scores:\")\nprint(home_scores.head())\n```\n\n*Try running it; you’ll see only the points the home teams scored in the first few games.*\n\n---\n\n#### 5.2 Filtering Rows (Selecting Specific Games)\n\nWhat if you want to see *only the games where the home team won?*\n\nA team wins if its score is higher than the other team’s. To find those games, we filter the DataFrame for rows where `HOME_SCORE` is greater than `AWAY_SCORE`:\n\n```python\n# Find games where the home team won\nhome_wins = nba_df[nba_df['HOME_SCORE'] > nba_df['AWAY_SCORE']]\n\n# Count how many home wins\nprint(f\"Number of home team wins so far: {home_wins.shape[0]}\")\n```\n\nThis line says: “Give me all the rows (games) where the home team scored *more* points than the away team.” Run it to see how many such games there are.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.3 Adding a New Column: Who Won Each Game?\n\nRight now, the table doesn’t tell us directly who the winner is. Let’s create a new column called `\"WINNER\"` that shows which team won each game:\n\n```python\n# Function to decide the winner of a game\ndef get_winner(row):\n    if row['HOME_SCORE'] > row['AWAY_SCORE']:\n        return row['HOME_TEAM']      # Home team wins\n    elif row['AWAY_SCORE'] > row['HOME_SCORE']:\n        return row['AWAY_TEAM']      # Away team wins\n    else:\n        return \"Tie\"                 # If both teams scored the same points\n\n# Apply this function to every row and create a new 'WINNER' column\nnba_df['WINNER'] = nba_df.apply(get_winner, axis=1)\n\n# Look at the updated data with the new column\nnba_df[['GAME_ID', 'HOME_TEAM', 'AWAY_TEAM', 'HOME_SCORE', 'AWAY_SCORE', 'WINNER']].head()\n```\n\nThe function `get_winner` looks at each game (row) and decides which team scored more points. The `.apply()` part adds the results as a new column to the DataFrame.\n\n---\n\n#### 5.4. Filtering in action\nLet's write a code to filter for games where the point difference was 10 points or more. Display the first 3 such games with columns: `GAME_ID`, `HOME_TEAM`, `AWAY_TEAM`, `DIFFERENCE`. Finally, find the number of games satisfying this condition.\n\nTo do it:\n```python\nbig_diff_games = nba_df[nba_df['DIFFERENCE'] >= 10] # point difference was 10 pts or more\n\nbig_diff_games[['GAME_ID', 'HOME_TEAM', 'AWAY_TEAM', 'DIFFERENCE']].head(3) # display the first 3 rows\n\nbig_diff_games.shape()[0] # don't fret! this just returns the number of games!\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1785248d-7c0e-4957-9281-b73ab3ea11c1"},{"source":"### Another quiz!\n\nCan you tell me the number of games that had a point difference of less than 3?
